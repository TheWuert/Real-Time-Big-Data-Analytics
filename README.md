## Purpose
This project focuses on applying real-time big data analytics techniques to baseball game data. The goal is to simulate a streaming data scenario and extract key moments and insights from the **Marlins vs. Dodgers** game on **April 29, 2025**.

## Research Questions
- Can we simulate and analyze game highlights using streaming data pipelines?
- How do we process and structure real-time play-by-play data?
- What patterns or highlights emerge when analyzing game events as they happen?

## Dataset Summary
- **Source**: Game event data (assumed from streaming or scraped source)
- **Game**: Marlins vs. Dodgers (4/29/25)
- **Format**: Structured as timestamped game events with player and play details.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas**: Data processing
- **Apache Spark (PySpark)**: For structured streaming
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment

## Key Observations (So Far)
- Play-by-play breakdown can highlight scoring plays and player contributions.
- Real-time streaming pipelines enable scalable analysis of continuous event data.
- This workflow simulates how big data systems ingest and respond to live sports data.
